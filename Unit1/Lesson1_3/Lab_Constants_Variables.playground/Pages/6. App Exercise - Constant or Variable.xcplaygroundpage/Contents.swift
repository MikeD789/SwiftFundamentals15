/*:
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let userName = "Mike"
print("The user's name is declared as a constant because it is unlikely to change.")
var userAge = 30
print("The user's age is declared as a variable because it can change over time.")
var stepsTakenToday = 8750
print("The number of steps taken today is declared as a variable because it will change throughout the day.")
let goalSteps = 10000
print("The goal number of steps is declared as a constant because it is usually set once and doesn't change often.")
var averageHeartRate = 72
print("The average heart rate is declared as a variable because it can change over time.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
